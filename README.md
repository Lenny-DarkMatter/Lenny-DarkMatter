- 👀 I’m interested in Astrophysics, especially galaxies, and all the state of the art computing and observation technique, as well as the modern possibilities in data analysis. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to reduce large data sets from numerical simulations to the essentials and to answer the outgoing questions as simply as possible with aesthetic plots.
- 💞️ I’m particularly ambitious to present (scientific) results in a clear and visually appealing way.
